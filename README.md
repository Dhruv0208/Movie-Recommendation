# Movie Recommendation
The python notebook shows two approaches that can be used build a movie recommedation system.
I have tested two approaches namely:
### Filter Based Approach

### Content Based Approach
The idea of collaborative filtering is that it can function in tandem with user or movie IDs.Users A and B, for instance, have different preferences for movies: A enjoys P, Q, R, and S, whereas B enjoys Q, R, S, and T. Given the similarity between the two users, movies Q, R, and S are recommended for user B, whereas movie T is advised for user A.
