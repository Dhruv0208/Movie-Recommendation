# Movie Recommendation
The python notebook shows two approaches that can be used build a movie recommedation system.
I have tested two approaches namely:
### Filter Based Approach
The idea is to filter out the movies based on there rating by different users. Then we sort the movies in descending order of there correlation with the name of the movie which is being entered.
### Content Based Approach
The idea of collaborative filtering is that it can function in tandem with user or movie IDs.Users A and B, for instance, have different preferences for movies: A enjoys P, Q, R, and S, whereas B enjoys Q, R, S, and T. Given the similarity between the two users, movies Q, R, and S are recommended for user B, whereas movie T is advised for user A.
